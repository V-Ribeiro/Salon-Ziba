        <p>There’s no better time than the New Year to shake things up and consider changing your look. This year, don’t be afraid to explore color! Funky hair colors are trending right now and can make a real statement. There are no limits, so be creative: whether you want to go for a hint of pink, a beautiful shade of blue or one of countless pastel colors, our stylists at Salon Ziba can help you achieve the hair color of your dreams. Read on for some colorful hair inspiration!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Shiny Gray</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The “Granny Look” has been popular for several years and is celebrating its comeback in 2020. The shiny, gray color goes with any hairstyle and ensures a cool look. In order to achieve this amazing look, we recommend booking Olaplex with your color treatment at Salon Ziba. A Cezanne anti-frizz treatment can go a long way as it provides long-lasting glow, smoothness and helps repair and protect your locks from damage.</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Pink Tips</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>You don’t want to color your hair completely but still crave some funky color accents? This look might be the perfect match for you! As you can see, funky colored tips can make a big difference. This stunning look can be achieved with any haircut, whether long or short, and with any hair color you desire. Question is, do you dare?</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Smoky Blue</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We’re in love with this unique color! The smoky blue isn’t as vibrant as we know blue hair normally to be, but still looks more than amazing. This cool look is the perfect color for every season and can be achieved at Salon Ziba. With high quality colors (such as L’Òreal), our stylists will create this beautiful shade for you. Book your appointment in our Midtown or Downtown NYC now online or via phone!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Slightly Lilac</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Pastel hair colors have always been our favorites – and we feel the same this year! There are countless different shades, you can play with the vibrancy and intensity of the colors and achieve unique results. The slightly lilac hair is definitely one of the most beautiful creations we’ve seen so far. A hint of color in combination with intense shine basically can’t look bad, ever!</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>With all the beautiful colors available, it might be hard to choose exactly which way you want to go with. We completely understand, and can tell you: you don’t have to choose! Why choose one color when you can have them all? With an artistic eye and expert highlighting skills, this stunning rainbow hairstyle can be achieved by booking with one of our master colorists. Go ahead, try something new.</p>
