        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Clean your hair and scalp on a regular basis</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Make sure to wash your hair regularly with a mild, cleansing shampoo and add a scalp scrub to your hair care routine. It’s important to keep your hair and scalp clean and remove dead skin cells as well as sebum and pollution particles. By doing so, you’re lowering the risk of infections and dandruff that may lead to hair breakage and hair loss. At Salon Ziba, our stylist will help you find the perfect products for your hair type. We offer diverse shampoos from luxurious brands like Kerastase, Shu Uemura or Oribe and other products to treat your scalp. Give us a visit in our Downtown or Midtown salon!

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Scalp Care</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Brushing your hair correctly is essential when trying to reduce hair loss. Keep in mind to always brush your hair when it’s dry. Wet hair is in its weakest state and shouldn’t be brushed as it increases hair loss significantly. If you really need to brush your hair wet, use a wide-toothed comb in order to prevent damage. In general, pay attention to how often you brush your hair. Brushing it too often can injure your hair and support hair loss. Try to detangle your hair with your fingers instead!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Change your diet</h4>
        
        <p>There are several vitamins and foods that can promote hair growth and let your hair grow stronger. A nutrient-rich and health-conscious diet will definitely help you reduce hair loss by covering essential basics. Concentrate on eating lean meats, fish, soy, other high protein foods and products rich in Vitamin A, Vitamin E and Vitamin B.  Vitamin A encourages a healthy production of your scalps sebum, Vitamin E promotes better blood circulation and Vitamin B helps to maintain your hair’s health. Give it a try!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Cut stress</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Stress is one of the main reasons for hair loss, as it can cause an autoimmune reaction that makes your body attack the hair follicles, resulting in hair loss. Along with this, the hormones released by our bodies when being stressed disrupt your hair growth cycle. As a result of this disruption, your hair starts resting and stops growing. We can’t give you an ultimate solution on how to cut stress, but it can definitely start with a relaxing day at Salon Ziba. <a href="../book-an-appointment.php" target="_blank">Schedule your appointment now!</a></p>
