        <br>
        
        <p>Your locks are likely to experience a lack of hydration which causes extreme dullness in colder weather. To keep your hair moisturized as possible, make sure to use a leave-in conditioner as that will be your hair’s best friend during the cold season. Leave-in conditioners help you keep your locks hydrated throughout the whole day, add smoothness and shine and fight frizz. There are several different products for every kind of hair, ensuring to treat each hair type as best as possible. Here’s a selection of the finest products:
        
        
        <ul>
        
        	<li>For very dry hair: Kerastase Nectar Thermique</li>
            <li>For unruly hair: Kerastase Keratine Thermique</li>
            <li>For damaged hair: Kerastase Ciment Thermique </li>
            <li>For skin & hair: Shu Uemura Essence Absolue Universal Hair Balm</li>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Scalp Care</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The cold months do not only have drying effects on your hair, but also on your scalp. Due to the lack of moisture, many people tend to have a dry, flaky scalp. As the health of your hair depends on the health of your scalp, it is important to keep your scalp in  great condition. In order to enjoy strong, shiny hair you may want to try one of the following products that treat your scalp: 
        
        <ul>
        
        	<li>Scalp Scrub: Kerastase Fusio Scrub (<a href="../services/treatments.php" target="_blank">in-salon treatment</a> or home treatment) </li>
            <li>Hair Care Routine : <a href="https://www.oribe.com/serenescalp/" target="_blank">Oribe Serene Scalp Collection</a> (available in our Midtown and Downtown salon) </li>
        
        </ul>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Dry Shampoo</h4>
        
        <br>
        <p>One of the best cures for dryness in the winter is to not wash your hair too often. Over-washing your hair means taking off its natural oils and causing your hair to become even drier than usual during the winter. If you need a little refresh, reach for a dry shampoo instead of washing. It does not only restore your hair within seconds, but also adds volume and texture. Here are some of the best dry shampoos:
        
        
        <ul>
        
        	<li>Salon Ziba Original: Salon Ziba Dry Cleaner</li>
            <li>For colored hair: Shu Uemura Color Lustre Dry Shampoo</li>
            <li>Luxurious Dry Cleaner: <a href="https://www.oribe.com/gold-lust-dry-shampoo.html" target="_blank">Oribe Gold Lust Dry Shampoo</a> (available in both our NYC salons)</li>
        
        </ul>
