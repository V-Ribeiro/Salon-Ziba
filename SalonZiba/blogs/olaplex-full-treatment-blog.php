In the world of hair repairing products, Olaplex is one that has been on the market for a few years and really stands out. The Olaplex treatment is a great solution for dry, damaged hair. It is not a conditioner, but rather a chemical treatment actively operating on a molecular level. This binds together the broken protein bonds of your hair. These proteins act as armor against internal and external damage.
<br>
<br>
For those of you who regularly dye their hair, or who have damaged hair, Olaplex is the perfect solution to get back your soft and luscious locks. For everyone else, this treatment is still a fantastic way to help achieve healthy hair!

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">How does Olaplex Work?</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>
Olaplex is a bond multiplier which contains a single active ingredient – Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate. In simple terms, an Olaplex treatment helps repair damaged hair, bringing back life and shine.

<br>
<br>

When your hair makes contact with chemical, thermal and mechanical processes commonly found in many products and services, the disulfide bonds in your hair break. This can leave your hair looking lifeless, or worse, damaged. Olaplex is designed to fight against this damage. Olaplex repairs damage by cross-linking single sulfur hydrogen bonds in your hair back together to form disulfide bonds.

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <p>The Olaplex treatment is a three step treatment designed to repair these broken bonds. The first product is the Olaplex No. 1 Bond Multiplier. This contains the concentrated active repairing ingredient. This first step in the process will rejuvenate your proteins and strengthen these bonds to prevent future breaks. The second step involves the use of Olaplex No. 2 Bond Perfector, and is used solely by hair salon professionals. It is designed to track and target any remaining broken bonds. The last step involves the use of Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector. This product is designed to be used from the comfort of your home to provide ongoing protection for your hair.</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">When should I get an Olaplex treatment?</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>If you think your hair might be permanently damaged from years of bleaching, or you simply want to add strength and shine to your hair, look no further: the Olaplex treatment is meant for you!

<br>
<br>

Olaplex can be used while getting your hair colored to minimize damaging effects of dye. It can also be paired with any other hair treatments to maximize their effect and prevent further damage.

<br>
<br>

At Salon Ziba, we offer <a href="../services/treatments.php" target="_blank">Olaplex Within Color Service.</a>

<br>
<br>

When dying your hair, the peroxide that is used in the products may stop the bond forming process between the keratin proteins in your hair. By adding Olaplex to the dying process, it will take action much faster than peroxide, effectively preventing it from damaging your precious keratin bonds.

<br>
<br>

At Salon Ziba, you can also get the <a href="../services/treatments.php" target="_blank">Olaplex Full Treatment.</a>

<br>
<br>

This is a standalone treatment intended to repair and rejuvenate your hair following the three step treatment described above.</p>


		<br>
        <br>
               
        <h4 class="servicesTitle">What is the process of an Olaplex treatment at the salon?</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <a href="../services/treatments.php" target="_blank">Olaplex Within Color Service</a>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>When getting your color done, Olaplex 1 will be mixed into the dye solution used in the process. Adding No. 1 Bond Multiplier will help alleviate the damage done during the color, lightening and relaxing process. But this step cannot prevent everything. This is why after all the hair color processing has been completed and rinsed, your stylist will lead you to the shampoo bowl to apply and comb Olaplex 2 through your hair, then leave it for 20 minutes or longer. This will ensure that the product finds the remaining bonds to strengthen, without the color, lightener and relaxers actively working against it. Finally, they will rinse out the product and apply shampoo and conditioner to your hair as usual.</p>
        
        <br>

        <a href="../services/treatments.php" target="_blank">Olaplex Full Treatment</a>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The Olaplex Full Treatment will find you in the trustworthy hands of one of our talented stylists at the shampoo bowl. First, your stylist will saturate your dry hair with a mix of Olaplex No. 1 and water, designed to find the broken bonds and build new connections between them, and leave it for 5 minutes. Then without rinsing, they will layer Olaplex No. 2 from your roots to your ends, on top of No. 1 Bond Multiplier, and comb through it thoroughly. This step will ensure that the previously missed broken bonds will also be targeted. They will leave the product for 20 minutes, then finally, they will rinse, shampoo and condition your hair as usual, leaving you with strengthened, shiny and soft hair.</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">How do I use Olaplex at home?</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>At home, you will be using Olaplex 3, designed to provide ongoing protection to your hair. No. 3 Hair Perfector is not a conditioner and is not meant to be left in your hair, you must remove it with shampoo.
        
        <br>
        <br>

Olaplex 3 is best applied to towel-dried hair. If there are any remaining oils or silicone-based products left in your hair, it is recommended to shampoo and towel dry your hair before starting the process.

		<br>
        <br>

Apply a generous amount and comb it through your hair. Leave it for 10 to 20 minutes or more for maximum efficiency. Afterwards, rinse the product off, then apply shampoo and conditioner as usual. For healthy hair, it can be used once a week, for damaged hair 2 to 3 times a week is recommended while pairing it to a moisturizer or protein treatment.</p>
