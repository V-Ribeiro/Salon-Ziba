        <p>Let’s be honest: nobody got time for static hair! As if the cold weather itself wasn’t enough, we have to take preventative steps to protect our hair from the harsh conditions the winter brings. One of the most annoying ones is static hair which makes you look as if you rubbed your hair on a balloon for hours. In general, static hair happens when your locks become charged with electricity. Each strand of hair is made out of atoms, which consist of protons, neutrons and electrons. In the moment two objects rub together, one of them loses its electrons and becomes positive, whereas the other object gains electrons and becomes negatively charged. During the winter, your hair is likely to rub against your scarf, hats, or even your sweater which causes static hair and ruins your whole look. Here are some tips on how to treat and prevent static hair!</p>

        <p>A lack of moisture increases the chance of having static hair. Therefore, it is essential for you to keep your locks nourished by using the right hair care products. Leave-In conditioners, hair serums and hair oils are great to ensure your hair won’t get too dry during the day. Besides keeping your hair moisturized, hairspray can help you to reduce static hair and flyaways. Pro tip: get all your favorite products in travel size and always take them with you wherever you go!</p>

        <p>Probably a normal well-rounded brush, like our Silver Paddle Brush, is your go to hair brush. We understand, as this sort of brush can accomplish anything. In most cases they’re great, but if you struggle with static hair, it may be time to try something new. Plastic brushes are non-conductive which means they may increase chances of static hair. Instead, consider using a wooden brush!  Wooden brushes are conductive, which help to get rid of the static in your hair.

        <br>
        
        <p>If you’re wondering how to get rid of static hair right from the beginning, the shower, think about how often you wash your hair. Overwashing your locks strips the moisture from your strands and doesn’t allow your natural oils to nourish your hair. A good way to keep moisture, would be to make sure to always use a conditioner after shampooing and a nourishing hair mask from time to time. By washing your hair less and using high quality products, you can improve your hair’s health and get rid of static hair for the long-term. <a href="../book-an-appointment.php" target="_blank">Visit us in one of our salons</a> and let our stylists find the perfect hair care match for your locks!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Clothing</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>Synthetic material, such as polyester or nylon, are likely to charge up really quick and be a factor when it comes to static hair. So, if your jacket, sweater, or scarf is made from synthetic material, it might be the cause for your static hair. Instead, try to wear clothes made from natural material. This can be cotton, wool or silk. Give it a try and we’re sure you’ll notice a difference!</p>
