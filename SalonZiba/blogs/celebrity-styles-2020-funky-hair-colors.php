        <br>
        
        <p>Pink hair has always been one of our favorites, and the trend doesn’t show any signs of slowing down this year. A few days ago, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ladygaga/" target="_blank">Lady Gaga</a> presented her pink locks in an interview with Oprah. The vibrant color looks absolutely stunning on her and is a great choice for everyone! Nor only for women, but also for men. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/justinbieber/" target="_blank">Justin Bieber</a> followed the trending pink hairstyle as well. You can see him rocking his new look in his latest music video!</p>

        <br>
        
        <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ddlovato/" target="_blank">Demi Lovato</a> basically turned <a href="https://www.instagram.com/billieeilish/" target="_blank">Billie Eilish’s</a> hairstyle around and colored her tips instead of her roots. This style is perfect for anyone who wants to give funky colors a try, without fully committing to a drastic change of style. Whether you go for the fiery combination of pink and black, like Demi, or for pretty much any other combination: the results will look amazing.  Get creative and find your favorite color combo! </p>
