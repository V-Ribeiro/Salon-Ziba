It’s hard to believe that the Holidays are already here, but it’s true! We’re counting down the days until Christmas and New Year’s, and like every year there are a million things that still need to be done. Do you feel the same?

<br>
<br>

It’s possible, due to all the rush the Holidays bring, that you may have forgotten to think about how to style your hair for the upcoming special events you’ll be attending. But there’s no need to worry, we’ve got you! In this blog, we’ll give you easy tutorials for last minute holidays hairstyles. Within minutes, you’ll be able to transform your hair into a beautiful look, fancy enough for any holiday party. Let’s get started!

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Upside Down</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>This stunning holiday look is way easier to create than it might look! Brush your hair well, turn your head upside down and start french braiding it from your neck. Once the braided part reaches the point you normally wear a high bun, it’s time to secure your locks with an elastic hair band. The only thing left to do now is to wrap your hair into a bun and secure the look with some bobby pins and hairspray. Done!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Volume, Volume, Volume</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>The holiday season is the perfect time to let your dreams of voluminous hair come true! With some easy steps, you can create this gorgeous style. Start by crimping your hair to add texture and volume. After doing so, secure the side sections of your hair with bobby pins to keep it away from your face. The next and final step is to push the top section of your hair up into the position you can see in the picture. To level up this look, you can simply use extravagant hair clips!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Loose Braids</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>You don’t need a ton of skill to achieve this amazing hairstyle! Start by adding a heat protectant to your locks, curl them and comb through with a wide comb. Once your locks are cooled down, you simply french braid the top sections from both sides of your head until they meet in the middle. Use a thin elastic band to secure the loose braids, add some hair accessories if you like and your holiday hairstyle is ready!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Twisted Look</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We love this beautiful twisted braid! It’s the perfect hairstyle for every occasion and done within minutes. Start by selecting two strands from the top section of your head and do a simple knot. After this, continue repeating these knots with lower strands, until the braid reaches your neck. Wrap a hairband around the braid to secure it and hide your ponytail with the help of some bobby pins under the knots you created. This was easy, right?!</p>

        <h4 class="servicesTitle">Upgraded fish braid</h4>
        
        <br>
        
        <p>We’re all fans of the simple fish braid, but what if we tell you there’s a simple way to make it look even better? Start by using a hair oil to add shine and protect your hair when straightening it. Take a small strand from the top of your head and start creating a fine fish braid. After a while, take two strands from the side of your head and work them into the braid. Do this as many times as you need. Finally, secure your hair with a small elastic band.</p>
