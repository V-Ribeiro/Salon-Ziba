        <br>
        
        <p>Your go-to brush for long hair and straight hair is our Silver Paddle Brush. The brush easily glides through your dry or wet locks and detangles it softly without pulling your hair out. Furthermore it helps to increase your hair’s shine by distributing the natural oils from your scalp into your hair strands. If you’re looking for a daily brush to treat your long or straight hair, this hair brush is your perfect match!</p>

The perfect brush for blowouts are our Large Aluminium Round Brush and Jumbo Aluminium Round Brush, depending on how tight or loose you want your waves to be. Both of the brushes heat quickly, enhance volume and let you create beautiful, soft waves that last. Get yours today!</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>Having bangs isn’t always that easy, and recreating the look your stylist creates at the salon, can seem impossible. Well, that’s not entirely true, you’ve probably just been using the wrong brush! Small round brushes get right under your bangs and help you achieve that pro-styling all by yourself. What’s really good about small round brushes, is that they help battle unruly hair and flyaways. Give it a try and get your small round brush here!</p>

This type of brush gently smoothes, slightly straightens and adds shine to your hair without destroying the look you created using your styling tools. We’re sure you’ll love it!</p>
