                Olaplex Full Treatment
                
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Beautiful hair often comes at a cost, at an expense to your hair. Color, bleach, double processed hair, color correction, highlights, balayage, perm, japanese straighteners, thermal reconditioning, keratin hair treatments, brazilian blowouts, hair extensions, and heat styling. Hair trends are always changing and it seems like we are constantly having surgeries performed on our hair when changing its structure. Therefore, our hair most definitely deserves a treat like Olaplex to help rejuvenate it to a healthier state. Since OLAPLEX is a “bond multiplier”, it will multiply and rebuild those bonds, lessening the damage and leave you with stronger hair, and healthier hair than it would otherwise be.</p>

            </p>
            
            
            <p>Going blonde involves bleach, so blondes are particularly susceptible to brittle, damaged hair, and hair breakage. OLAPLEX will help with that damage/breakage. Plus, because it’s so effective in minimizing damage, your colorist may be able to achieve lighter hair than would otherwise be possible.</p>

                Brazilian Keratin Treatment
                
            </p>
            
            
            <p>The Brazilian Keratin Hair Treatment (also known as a Brazilian Blowout) is a revolutionary process that softens, shines and straightens hair. The straightening treatment is gentle enough to be used on children. This is a natural treatment, Keratin is a natural substance that comprises approximately 88% of your hair. The treatment is healthy, it penetrates the hair repairing internal damaged hair, and coats the hair preventing further damaged hair. The results are smooth, silky, shiny, and straight hair.
You will be amazed at how dramatically easy it is to style your hair once you have had your Brazilian Keratin Treatment.</p>
